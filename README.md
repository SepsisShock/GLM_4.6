This preset was made for GLM 4.6 speficailly. It's gonna look fucky without the 2 regexes, titled roast.

Only tested on direct api Zai, not sure how well it will do on Open Router, Nanogpt, etc.

Single user message, streaming off, temp .79 ~ .85, FP & PP 0, top p 1. I don't know about other sampler settings. Continue prefill selected, squash system messages deselected, reasoning effort auto.

Special thanks to Izumi for the original Tucao, BF for the translation of said prompt which I then heavily modified tf out of, Bonsai Senapai for the analyze prompt, and GenericStatement for his various GLM contributions, and Subscribe for his support.
