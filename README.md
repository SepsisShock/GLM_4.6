This preset was made for GLM 4.6 speficailly. It's gonna look fucky without the 2 regexes, titled roast.

Only tested on direct api Zai, not sure how well it will do on Open Router, Nanogpt, etc.

Special thanks to Izumi for the original Tucao, BF for the translation of said prompt which I then heavily modified tf out of, Bonsai Senpai for the analyze prompt, and GenericStatement for his various GLM contributions, and my nephew Subscribe for his support.
