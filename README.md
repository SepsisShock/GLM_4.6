This preset was made for GLM 4.6 speficailly. It's gonna look fucky without the 2 regexes, titled roast.

Only tested on direct api Zai, not sure how well it will do on Open Router, Nanogpt, etc.

For regexes, the higher the number inside () the newwer it is cuz I am lazy. GLM json files seem pretty self-explanatory for most recent. You will need both 1 finder 1 block regex for stuff to appear correctly - otherwise it will still appear but look kinda ugly.

Special thanks to Izumi for the original Tucao, BF for the translation of said prompt which I then heavily modified tf out of, Bonsai Senpai for the analyze prompt, and GenericStatement for his various GLM contributions, and my nephew Subscribe for his support.

DietGLM4chanV2 is the most recent; removed the emojis because it was causing problems for at least one person.
